     	<h2>The Muslim Problem</h2>
         <img src="islam3.png">
         <p>"Absolutely, yes. In fact I went a step further. I said I didn’t see Swedish people knocking down the World Trade Center.And by the way, many, many, most Muslims are wonderful people, but is there a Muslim problem? Look what’s happening. Look what happened right here in my city with the World Trade Center and lots of other places."</p>
         
         <p>"The Quran is very interesting. A lot of people say it teaches love … But there’s something there that teaches some very negative vibe … Now I don’t know if that’s from the Quran. I don’t know if that’s from someplace else. But there’s tremendous hatred out there that I’ve never seen anything like it."</p><a href="http://www.thepoliticalinsider.com/video-resurfaces-donald-trumps-views-on-the-muslim-problem-whoa/"><img src="pi.png"> </a></div>

    <h2>On Immigration -- Because Everyone is from Mexico</h2>
    <img src="america.png">
	<p>"When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."</p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/08/donald-trumps-false-comments-connecting-mexican-immigrants-and-crime/"><img src="wp.png"></a>

     <h2>Women? -- "Bitch Be Cool"</h2>
     <img src="woman.png">
	<p>"My favorite part [of 'Pulp Fiction'] is when Sam has his    gun out in the diner and he tells the guy to tell his girlfriend to shut up. Tell that bitch to be cool. Say: 'Bitch be cool.' I love those lines." -- TrumpNation: The Art of Being The Donald, 2005</p>
     
    <p>"Women have one of the great acts of all time. The smart ones act very feminine and needy, but inside they are real killers. The person who came up with the expression ‘the weaker sex’ was either very naive or had to be kidding. I have seen women manipulate men with just a twitch of their eye — or perhaps another body part." -- Trump: The Art of the Comeback, 1997</p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/18-real-things-donald-trump-has-said-about-women_us_55d356a8e4b07addcb442023/"><img src="huff3.png"></a></div>
